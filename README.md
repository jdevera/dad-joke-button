# 🔴 Dad Joke Button

> _"Hey León, if you could build a website or an app right now, what would you build?"_
> _"A big red button. And when you press it, it tells you a dad joke."_

And so it was built. 🎉

## 🤣 What Is This?

A gloriously simple website with one purpose: **a giant red button that delivers dad jokes on demand.**

- 🔘 **One big red button** — that's it, that's the whole UI
- 📦 **300 handcrafted dad jokes** — curated for maximum groan
- 🔀 **Shuffled every time** — no repeats until you've seen them all
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** — deliver dad jokes on the go
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🚀 Try It

👉 **[Launch the Dad Joke Button](https://jdevera.github.io/dad-joke-button/)**

Or run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdevera/dad-joke-button.git
cd dad-joke-button
open index.html
```

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. You see a button
2. You press the button
3. You get a dad joke
4. You groan
5. Go to step 2

## 💡 Origin Story

I asked my son León: "If you could build a website or an app right now, what would you build?" He described a website with a big red button that says "Dad Joke" — and when you press it, it gives you a joke. Press it again, another joke. And so on, forever.

So we built exactly that.
